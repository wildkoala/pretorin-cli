# Pretorin Compliance Skill

Query authoritative compliance framework data via the Pretorin MCP server. Access controls, families, document requirements, and implementation guidance from NIST 800-53, NIST 800-171, FedRAMP, and CMMC.

## Prerequisites

The Pretorin MCP server must be connected. If tools like `pretorin_list_frameworks` are not available, instruct the user to run:

```bash
uv tool install pretorin
pretorin login
claude mcp add --transport stdio pretorin -- pretorin mcp-serve
```

## Available Frameworks

| Framework ID | Title | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| `nist-800-53-r5` | NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 | 324 |
| `nist-800-171-r3` | NIST SP 800-171 Rev 3 | 130 |
| `fedramp-low` | FedRAMP Rev 5 Low | 135 |
| `fedramp-moderate` | FedRAMP Rev 5 Moderate | 181 |
| `fedramp-high` | FedRAMP Rev 5 High | 191 |
| `cmmc-l1` | CMMC 2.0 Level 1 | 17 |
| `cmmc-l2` | CMMC 2.0 Level 2 | 110 |
| `cmmc-l3` | CMMC 2.0 Level 3 | 24 |

Always call `pretorin_list_frameworks` to get the current list rather than relying on this table.

## Control ID Formatting

Control and family IDs must be formatted correctly or the API will return errors. See `references/control-id-formats.md` for the full format guide. Key rules:

- **NIST/FedRAMP**: families are slugs (`access-control`), controls are zero-padded (`ac-01`)
- **CMMC**: families include level (`access-control-level-2`), controls are dotted (`AC.L2-3.1.1`)
- **800-171**: controls are dotted (`03.01.01`)

When unsure of an ID, discover it first with `pretorin_list_control_families` or `pretorin_list_controls`.

## Tools

### Browsing Frameworks
- **`pretorin_list_frameworks`** — List all available frameworks. No parameters. Start here when the user hasn't specified a framework.
- **`pretorin_get_framework`** — Get framework metadata and AI context (purpose, target audience, regulatory context, scope, key concepts). Pass `framework_id`.
- **`pretorin_list_control_families`** — List control families with AI context (domain summary, risk context, implementation priority). Pass `framework_id`.

### Querying Controls
- **`pretorin_list_controls`** — List controls for a framework. Pass `framework_id` and optionally `family_id` to filter by family.
- **`pretorin_get_control`** — Get full control details including AI guidance (summary, control intent, evidence expectations, implementation considerations, common failures, complexity). Pass `framework_id` and `control_id`. The `ai_guidance` field provides the richest context for generating narratives and analyzing gaps.
- **`pretorin_get_control_references`** — Get implementation guidance, objectives, and related controls. Pass `framework_id` and `control_id`. This is the most detailed view — use it to understand how to implement a control.

### Documentation
- **`pretorin_get_document_requirements`** — Get required and implied documents for a framework. Pass `framework_id`. Returns explicit (required) and implicit (control-implied) documents with their control references.

### System & Implementation Context
- **`pretorin_get_control_context`** — Get rich context for a control including AI guidance, statement, objectives, scope status, and current implementation details. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`. This is the most comprehensive view for understanding both what a control requires and how it's currently implemented.
- **`pretorin_get_scope`** — Get system scope/policy information including excluded controls and Q&A responses. Pass `system_id`. Useful for understanding what's in/out of scope before generating narratives.
- **`pretorin_get_control_implementation`** — Get implementation details including current narrative, evidence_count, and notes. Use this to read current state before writing updates.
- **`pretorin_get_control_notes`** — Get notes for a control implementation. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, and optionally `framework_id`.
- **`pretorin_update_narrative`** — Push a narrative text update for a control implementation. Pass `system_id`, `control_id`, `framework_id`, and `narrative`. Use this after generating a narrative to save it to the platform.
- **`pretorin_create_evidence`** — Upsert evidence (find-or-create by default with `dedupe: true`) and return whether it was created or reused. Pass `system_id`, `name`, `description`, `evidence_type`, and control/framework context.
- **`pretorin_link_evidence`** — Link an existing evidence item to a control (low-level helper).
- **`pretorin_add_control_note`** — Add a note for unresolved gaps or manual follow-up actions.

## Narrative + Evidence + Notes Workflow

For any control update, follow this exact sequence:

1. Resolve the target `system_id`, `control_id`, and `framework_id`
2. Read current state first:
   - `pretorin_get_control_context`
   - `pretorin_get_narrative` or `pretorin_get_control_implementation`
   - `pretorin_search_evidence`
   - `pretorin_get_control_notes`
3. Collect only observable facts from the codebase and connected MCP systems
4. Draft updates:
   - Narrative update (include TODO placeholders for unknowns)
   - Evidence upserts
   - Gap notes for unresolved/manual items
5. Push updates:
   - `pretorin_update_narrative`
   - `pretorin_create_evidence` (dedupe on by default)
   - `pretorin_add_control_note`

### No-Hallucination Requirements

- Never claim an implementation detail unless it is directly observed.
- Mark uncertain or missing information as unknown.
- Use auditor-friendly markdown with no section headings.
- Narratives must include at least two rich markdown elements and at least one structural element (`code block`, `table`, or `list`).
- Evidence descriptions must include at least one rich markdown element.
- Rich markdown elements include: fenced code blocks, tables, lists, and links.
- Do not include markdown images until platform-side image evidence upload support is available.
- For missing narrative data, insert this exact block:

```text
[[PRETORIN_TODO]]
missing_item: <what is missing>
reason: Not observable from current workspace and connected MCP systems
required_manual_action: <what user must do on platform/integrations>
suggested_evidence_type: <policy_document|configuration|...>
[[/PRETORIN_TODO]]
```

- For each unresolved gap, add one control note in this format:

```text
Gap: <short title>
Observed: <what was verifiably found>
Missing: <what could not be verified>
Why missing: <access/system limitation>
Manual next step: <explicit user/platform action>
```

## Workflows

### Framework Selection
Help users pick the right framework for their situation. See `references/framework-selection-guide.md` for the full decision tree covering federal agencies, contractors, CSPs, and defense industrial base organizations.

### Compliance Gap Analysis
Systematically assess a codebase against a framework's controls. See `references/gap-analysis-workflow.md` for the step-by-step methodology including family prioritization, evidence collection patterns, and status assessment criteria. See `examples/gap-analysis.md` for a sample output.

### Compliance Artifact Generation
Produce structured JSON artifacts documenting how a specific control is implemented. See `references/artifact-schema.md` for the full schema and field guidelines. See `examples/artifact-example.md` for complete examples with good vs weak evidence.

### Cross-Framework Mapping
Map controls across related frameworks using the related controls returned by `pretorin_get_control_references`. See `examples/cross-framework-mapping.md` for a worked example mapping Account Management across four frameworks.

### Document Readiness Assessment
Assess documentation readiness by calling `pretorin_get_document_requirements`, then prioritize: required documents first, then documents referenced by the most controls.
